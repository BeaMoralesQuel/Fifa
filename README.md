#1: Understanding the data

In this first step we have been checking and understanding what information we had in each column, which variable would be the best to create the model with machine learning. 

#2: cleaning the data

Once we had this clear, we started to clean our data frame. For this we have dropping unnecesary columns, treated unnecesary errors, transformed some columns, changed data types or treated nans.

#3: Features selection

Once we have our new data frame ready, we have moved on to check the correlation between our target and the rest of the selected data.

#4: Training the model

With this checked, and making some further adjustments to our selected data, we move on to training the model. We have done the separation of X and Y, then separated the numerical part from the categorical part, standardised both parts, and concatenated it all together again. 

Finally in this section we have entered the model with our test data.
